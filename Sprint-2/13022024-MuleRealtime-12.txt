As a developer I want to develop API based on RAML and based on the below requirements
/deposit :
deposit resource is used to deposit the Balance of Valid account
• Before deposit fetching total balance, you have to check whether there is any account
existing with accountNumber and Bank Name.
• If no, return the response saying “Account 1234567890 does not exist .
Enter Valid Details”
• If yes , deposit the amount , fetch previous balance and add the current deposit amount
Note :
• Upon successful deposit amount, send out a mail using GMAIl:
• Subject : Amount deposit done for SBI is done today !
• To : the email id sent in Body
• From : your gmail id
• Body : This is to inform you that your account has been Credited 123.00 today and total balance is 34567.


{
          "accountNum": "1234567892",
          "bank": "HDFC",
          "depositAmount" : 3000
        }
		
update bank_transactions 
    set TOTALBALANCE =:totalAmount
