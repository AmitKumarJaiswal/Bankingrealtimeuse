Desing for deposit API 
Development for deposit API 



copy input payload into another variable:

%dw 2.0
var inp= []
output application/json
---
inp << payload reduce ((item, accumulator) ->  item )


[1,2,3,4 ]

number + array -- wrong 
number + number -- correct 
org.mule.runtime.core.api.expression.ExpressionRuntimeException: "You called the function '+' with these arguments: 
  1: Number (3000 as Number {encoding: "UTF-8", mediaType: "application/json; charset=UTF-...)
  2: Array ([0E-9 as Number {class: "java.math.BigDecimal"}])

But it expects one of these combinations:
  (Array, Any)
  (Date, Period)
  (DateTime, Period)
  (LocalDateTime, Period)
  (LocalTime, Period)
  (Number, Number)
  (Period, DateTime)
  (Period, LocalDateTime)
  (Period, Time)
  (Period, Date)
  (Period, LocalTime)
  (Time, Period)

As a developer I want to develop API based on RAML and based on the below requirements
/deposit :
deposit resource is used to deposit the Balance of Valid account
• Before deposit fetching total balance, you have to check whether there is any account
existing with accountNumber and Bank Name.
• If no, return the response saying “Account 1234567890 does not exist .
Enter Valid Details”
• If yes , deposit the amount , fetch previous balance and add the current deposit amount

Note :
• Upon successful deposit amount, send out a mail using GMAIl:
• Subject : Amount deposit done for SBI is done today !
• To : the email id sent in Body
• From : your gmail id
• Body : This is to inform you that your account has been Credited 123.00 today and total balance is 34567.
