								      Session-19
							------------------------------
Recap:
------
Design an API for Lock/Unlock Account  (Admins/banks) 
Design for get all Locked Accounts 
Creted repo in Azure ADO 

Agenda:
--------
Develop an API for Lock/Unlock Account  (Admins/banks) 
Develop an API to get all Locked Accounts 

vitech-bank-cust-acct-LockUnlock

Create repository in ADO 
Create sample projet from Anypoint studio
Copy sample project code into ADO repo 
Delete Sample project from Anypoint Studio and Import the project from ADO Repo


Import the RAML from Design Center . RAML will be available in src/main/resource 

Lock:
--------
sizeOf(payload) == 1 and payload.ACCOUNTSTATUS[0] == "Active" and vars.inputPayload.acctStatus == "Lock"
     update the db as Locked 
	 
sizeOf(payload) == 1 and payload.ACCOUNTSTATUS[0] == "Locked" and vars.inputPayload.acctStatus == "Lock"
   Send a message saying like "Your account is alredy locked"
   
 Unlock
---------- 
sizeOf(payload) == 1 and payload.ACCOUNTSTATUS[0] == "Locked" and vars.inputPayload.acctStatus == "Unlock"
     update the db as Active 
	 
sizeOf(payload) == 1 and payload.ACCOUNTSTATUS[0] == "Active" and vars.inputPayload.acctStatus == "Unlock"
   Send a message saying like "Your account is alredy in Active Status"   
   


Task-2 
----------
 Complete GMAIL integration for this API (lock/unlock scenario)
 Create Azure pipelines and deploy this into cloud hub 
 
Task-1: (High)  (Similar to check balance) Session-16 & 17
--------------
Design-Create REST API for withdraw an amount
As a developer I want to desing RAML by using the below requirements
/withDraw :
Method : POST
queryParams :
bank - required: should be one of enum values ICICI , AXIS ,HDFC,SBI
type - required : should be on of enum values [savings , current]
accountNum - required: should be string and min max length is 10
 atmPin : required : type string (but pass numbers in string) min max length = 4 amountToBeWithdraw : Required. it should be number
Sample Response : 200 :
{“status” : “Amount xxxx is debited . Your total balance is xxxxxxxx”}



Develop- REST API for withdraw an amount
/withDraw :

 
withDraw resource is used to withdraw the amount from Valid account
All validations done for checkBalance should be done here as well (make use of
sub-flows and flows so that you can re-use the logic)

• Before fetching total balance, you have to check whether there is any account
existing with accountNumber and Bank Name.

• If no, return the response saying “Account 1234567890 does not exist .
Enter Valid Details”

• If yes , check whether “accountStatus” = “Active” .If not, return
response saying “Account 1234567890 temporarily locked. Please visit nearest Branch”

• If account exists with accountNumber and Bank Name and status is “Active”.
Check for atmPin whether it is valid or not

• If atmPin is incorrect , and “wrongPin” value is already 3 then update
accountstatus column in Database to “Locked” and return response :

 “Maximum Attempts reached .Your Account 1234567890 is temporarily locked. Please reach nearest Branch”

• If “wrongPin” value is less than 3 , then increment by 1 for every wrong
attempt and return response saying “Login Attempt Failed .Attempts left : 2”

<<Main logic>>
• If atmPin is correct :
• Check if total Balance is less than amountTobeWithdrawn , then send
out a response saying “Insufficient Funds”

• if total Balance is greater than amountTobeWithdrawn . Then deduct
amount and update the Database with final balance after deduction

• Send out a response as defined in RAML

Note :
• Upon failure attempts , send out a mail using GMAIl:
• Subject : Failed Attempt !
• To : the email id sent in Body
• From : your gmail id
• Body : This is to inform you that there’s a failed attempt happened
while transaction . Your Account will be locked after 3 attempts
• Upon All attempts failed, send out a mail using GMAIl:
• Subject : Account Locked !
• To : the email id sent in Body
• From : your gmail id
• Body : This is to inform you that Your Account has been be locked
due to 3 failed attempts. Please reach out nearest branch to unLock
• Upon Successful withdrawal , send out a mail using GMAIl:
• Subject : Transaction Alert!
• To : the email id sent in Body
• From : your gmail id
• Body : This is to inform you that Your Account has been debited with

xxxx amount and your Total Balance is xxxx
