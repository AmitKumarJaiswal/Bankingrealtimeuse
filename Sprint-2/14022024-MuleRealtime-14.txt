requirements :


As a developer I want to develop API based on RAML and based on the below requirements
/checkBalance :
 
checkBalance resource is used to check the total Balance of Valid account
• Before fetching total balance, you have to check whether there is any account
existing with accountNumber and Bank Name.
• If no, return the response saying “Account 1234567890 does not exist .
Enter Valid Details”
• If yes , check whether “accountStatus” = “Active” .If not, return
response saying “Account 1234567890 temporarily locked. Please visit
nearest Branch”
• If account exists with accountNumber and Bank Name and status is “Active”.
Check for atmPin whether it is valid or not
• If atmPin is incorrect , and “wrongPin” value is already 3 then update
accountstatus column in Database to “Locked” and return response :
 “Maximum Attempts reached .Your Account 1234567890 is
temporarily locked. Please reach nearest Branch”
• If “wrongPin” value is less than 3 , then increment by 1 for every wrong
attempt and return response saying “Login Attempt Failed .Attempts
left : 2”
• If atmPin is correct , the display the response as described in RAML
